# Merging and Pull Requests

## Step 1: Create a Pull Request (Optional)
 -  When uploading either complex code, or a large amount of code, or you want your changes reviewed before merging:
  - Click on "Branch" in the menu bar and select "Create Pull Request".
  - Review the changes and provide a title and description for your pull request.
  - If applicable, assign reviewers and label the pull request accordingly.
  - Click on "Create pull request" to submit it for review.

## Step 2: Review and Address Feedback
- After creating a pull request, your changes will be reviewed and feedback will be provided.
- Address any feedback by making additional changes to your code and committing them to the same branch.

## Step 3: Merge Pull Request
- Once your pull request has been approved and all feedback addressed:
  - Click on the "Current branch" dropdown menu and select the branch you created the pull request from.
  - Click on "Pull request" in the menu bar and select "Merge into <base_branch>".
  - Confirm the merge to integrate your changes into the base branch.
  - Optionally, delete the branch after merging if it's no longer needed.

## Step 4: Update Local Repository
- After merging the pull request, click on "Fetch origin" to retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository.
- If your local branch is behind the updated base branch, GitHub Desktop will prompt you to update it.
- Click on "Update <branch_name>" to bring your local branch up to date with the remote repository.

## Step 5: Continue Development
- With your changes merged into the main codebase, continue working on new features or fixes by creating new branches and following the same process.
